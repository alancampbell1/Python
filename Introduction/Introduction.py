Python is a high level programming language for general purpose programming. It was first
released in 1991 and emphasises code readability and uses considerable whitespace.

It is used for web development (server-side), software development, mathematics and
scripting.

What can Python do?
- Can be used on a server to create web applications
- Can be used alongside software to create workflows
- Can connect to database systems and read/modify files
- Handle Big Data and perform complex mathematics
- Used for rapid prototyping or production ready software development

The most recent version of Python is Python 3. However, Python 2 is still popular.

Python was designed for readability and has some similarities to the English language.
In Python, a new line completes a command, unlike Java which uses a semi-colon.

Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope for loops, functions
and classes. Other languages uses curly brackets.

Indentation is vital for Python. As shown below, we are in the if statement through the
whitespace.
